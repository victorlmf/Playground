# Playground

This is a Flask project to display a HTML page to show different number and color of boxes based on the number and color we enter in the localhost route. 

Level 1: Renders a page with three blue boxes when a user visits http://localhost:5000/play.
Level 2: Displays the blue boxes (x) times when a user visits http://localhost:5000/play/(x)
  Ex: http://localhost:5000/play/7 should display these blue boxes 7 times.
Level 3: Displays the boxes (x) times and appears in (color) when a user visits http://localhost:5000/play/(x)/(color)
  Ex: http://localhost:5000/play/5/green should display these boxes 5 times with the color of green.
